**Handwritten Digit Recognition**

**Objective**
The goal of this project is to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Libraries Required
`tensorflow` or `keras` for building the neural network
`matplotlib` for `visualization`

**Dataset**
I have used the **MNIST** dataset for this project. It is a widely-used dataset for handwritten digit recognition and contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

**Installation**
To install the required libraries, you can use the following pip commands:


**Libraries to be installed:** 
`pip install tensorflow`
`pip install matplotlib`

**How to Run**
    - Clone this repository to your local machine.
    - Navigate to the project directory.
    - Run the Python script handwritten_digit_recognition.py.

**Code Overview**
    - Import Libraries: Import all the necessary libraries such as tensorflow and matplotlib.

    - Load Data: Load the MNIST dataset.

    - Data Preprocessing: Reshape and normalize the image data.

    - Build Model: Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Keras.

    - Compile and Train: Compile and train the model on the training data.

    - Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model on the test data.

    - Visualization: Visualize the model predictions on test data.
