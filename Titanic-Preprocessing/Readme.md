# Titanic Data Preprocessing Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the initial steps of data analysis, which includes data cleaning and preprocessing, using the Titanic dataset. The dataset contains various features like age, sex, fare, and whether the passenger survived or not.

## Objective
The main objective is to understand the dataset by performing exploratory data analysis and to prepare the data for machine learning models.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Files in the Repository
- `titanic.csv`: The raw dataset containing information about Titanic passengers.
- `Data_Preprocessing_Titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code.
- `Output.md`: Markdown file containing the output and explanation of each step.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Data_Preprocessing_Titanic.ipynb`).
3. Run all the cells in the notebook.
