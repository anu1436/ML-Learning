### **Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews**

### Objective

To analyze movie reviews and classify them as either positive or negative.

### Libraries Needed

- **`nltk`** for natural language processing
- **`sklearn`** for machine learning

### Data

For this project, we can use the IMDb dataset or any other dataset containing movie reviews and their sentiments.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Download or collect a dataset containing movie reviews and their sentiments (positive/negative).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text data, remove stop words, and perform stemming or lemmatization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convert the text data into numerical form using techniques like Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF.
4. **Model Training**: Use a machine learning algorithm like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression to train the model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
6. **Prediction**: Classify new movie reviews as positive or negative.
